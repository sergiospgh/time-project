## Development server

1. Check if nodejs is enabled on your computer running `node --version`.

If it is not installed you must download and install the LTS version of nodejs from `https://nodejs.org/`.

2. Once you have nodejs installed correctly, you have to move to the project path and you can run on a terminal the following commands.

3. Run `npm install` to install all the needed packages and libraries.
4. Run `npm run start` or `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
